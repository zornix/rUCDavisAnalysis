This file contains the extract stage of our pipeline

We will pull raw post data using Reddit's public JSON API.

The core functionality is:
    - fetch posts in batches of up to 100 (as per reddit's rate limits)
    - filter out posts younger than MIN_POST_AGE_HOURS (defined in config.py)
    - track where we left off in the scraping process by saving the cursor pointer to a file at the end of every extraction
        (CURSOR_FILE, defined in config.py)

"""
this function will save the cursor point to the disk as a file at the end of every extraction.

this will allow us to resume from the same point, when we run the pipeline again to get another batch of posts

the json responce contains the "after" token. we can access it by response.json()["data"]["after"]

this function should save the "after" token to file CURSOR_FILE (as per config.py)

create a dictionary with the key "after" and the value of the token.
also create a key "last_run", the value should be the current timestamp (when the pipeline ran)
eg. { "after": "t3_1riemy0", "last_run": "2026-03-01T12:00:00" }

write as json to CURSOR_FILE

this function will check if a post is old enough to be included in our dataset and return a boolean value.
we only want posts that are at least MIN_POST_AGE_HOURS old.

the json responce contains the "created_utc" timestamp as a float (e.g. 1772418658.0)

pandas has a function to convert this to a datetime object: pd.to_datetime(timestamp, unit="s")
