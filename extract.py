"""
This file contains the extract stage of our pipeline

We will pull raw post data using Reddit's public JSON API.

The core functionality is:
    - fetch posts in batches of up to 100 (as per reddit's rate limits)
    - filter out posts younger than MIN_POST_AGE_HOURS (defined in config.py)
    - track where we left off in the scraping process by saving the cursor pointer to a file at the end of every extraction
        (CURSOR_FILE, defined in config.py)
